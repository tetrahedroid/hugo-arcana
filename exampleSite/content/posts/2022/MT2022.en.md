A new paper from our group has been published.

In a previous paper, we examined the regularity with which the crystal structure of inclusion hydrates is chosen. We applied that approach to a new mixed gas inclusion hydrates and group 14 clathrate compounds.

In the former, we presented an overarching explanation for why mixing gases may change the crystal structure. Adding just a few molecules of a certain type may significantly change the crystal structure.

In the latter case, we showed that even in clathrate compounds of group 14 elements such as silicon, it is difficult to create anything other than a limited crystal structure, as is the case with inclusion hydrates Clathrate compounds of group 14 elements are attracting attention as semiconductor materials. This study provides a clue to consider crystal structure control.
